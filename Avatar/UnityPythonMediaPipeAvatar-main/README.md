# Unity + Python Google MediaPipe Avatar

## Overview
This project is an attempt at binding the pose generated by MediaPipePose to arbitrary humanoid avatars inside of Unity. MediaPipe runs fully in Python and the results are piped to Unity for the avatar and visualization. The model, WebCam reading, and game all run on different threads.<br>

## Installation
1. Install Python and Unity (2021.3.24f1 was used, but any version close to that should be fine).
2. pip install mediapipe
3. Clone/download this repository.
4. Run main.py using Python.
5. Run the Unity project while inside SampleScene.
6. Follow the on-screen instructions. You must copy the pose of the avatar using your webcam for calibration.
7. Move around after the calibration to control the avatar.

### Tracking for Arbitrary Humanoid Avatars
By default, this project includes Unity-chan for testing. If you wanted to use other 3D models, see below:
1. The humanoid avatar must be rigged for animation and configured as humanoid in the Unity Rig import settings. Also, the following bones are required: Upper Arm -> Hand, Upper Leg -> Foot, Hips -> Chest, Neck -> Head. Most humanoid avatars will have this by default.
2. The resting pose of the avatar should be a T-pose.
3. Add the Avatar script to the GameObject and correctly assign all the fields.

Contact me if you're having trouble with this.


## Current Limitations
* Currently only supports front facing movement (you must be facing the camera). I will work on upgrading this solution over time. This is my first attempt, but it will work quite well for general pose detection.
* If you are interested in only the body pose and not avatar see [this other project](https://github.com/ganeshsar/UnityPythonMediaPipeBodyPose).

### Notes:
* See global_vars.py for some basic configuration options to speed up/improve precision of the detection/customize the WebCam reading.
* Wearing clothing that contrasts with a background helps a fair bit. Also, good lighting in the room.
* DO NOT minimize the Python application when running Windows as this causes the processing to become a background task creating a lot of lag.
* There is no limitation on the number of Avatars you can have in scene (up to performance limitations).
